# Artifact for "Software Quality Assurance Analytics: Enabling Software Engineers to Reflect on QA Practices"

Welcome to our artifact!
In here we provide additional information for you to retrace our steps in the interview analysis.
It has the following contents:

- `codebook.xlsx`: Our full codebook with our open codes, structured after the axial codes that emerged. `codebook-statistics.xlsx` lists for each code in which participant's interview it can be found.
- `generate-figures`: The plain data and scripts used to generate the figures in the paper.
- `survey.pdf`: An printout of our whole online questionnaire that guided the participants through the pretest-posttest study and the interview.
- `survey-answers.xlsx`: The complete data for our participants answers in the online survey during the interviews.
- `repoinsights-dashboard-software`: The code of our prototype repoinsights. As it is under active development, this is not yet documented for replicating the study setup or extending it. Still, we are providing the source code for transparency and will publish a version with comprehensive setup instructions later.
